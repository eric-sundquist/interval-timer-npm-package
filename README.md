[Lab-2-instructioner](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jIFavAG_4qCO9P8DC2EjSLTe_HSH98LkP3rpvyU0Au0/edit#)

## Vision

Tick-Tock Interval Timer app let the user define a working timer followed by a resting timer. These intervals can then by multiplied in forms of sets. Upon start and end of a working session the user is notified. The application is presented as a web app with a simplistic and minimalistic user interface.

To set up a new timer the user defines a working time, resting time and how many times they should repeat, i.e. sets.

## Requirements

### Functional requirements

1. On inital applikation load a user should be able to define a working time, resting time and amount of sets.
2. After setting these parameters the user should be able to start the interval.
3. On Initial start the timer will do a prepare countdown of 5 seconds.
4. A user should be able to pause and reset a started interval.
5. When working starts the user should be notified (sound, color, text)
6. When working ends the user should be notified (sound, color, text)
7. After the working time on the last set the timer should finish (not run the last rest timer)
8. (?) Spara presets
9. (?) Ställa in fler variabler för intervall. Till exempel köra 7:3 x 6 rep x 5 set. hangboard.

### Non-Functional requirements

1. Applikationen ska finnas tillgänglig i webbläsaren.
2. Ska använda tick-tock timer modulen.
